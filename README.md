How do user activities during race events correlate with their merchandise purchases and sponsorship interaction? 
Users which had higher predictive accuracy were more likely to click sponsors ads. They also were more likely to click ads if they had completed more challenges and spent more time.

New Fan challenge:
Which team will be first out of (four lowest ranking teams). This will cause more engagement because it will keep users on the platform longer to watch the events and also since it is only out of four options their accuracy will be higher promoting more ads. There is already a challenge for fastest so making one for slowest would be similar. The monetization would be off ads since this would keep users captivated for longer. Also users like to root for the underdog.
